# Introduction

This project allows us to write styles using SCSS and compile them to a single, minified, CSS file that can be included in your project.

We've included the [stylelint-config-gds](https://github.com/alphagov/stylelint-config-gds) as the basis for a `stylelint` linter that runs as you debug/build your styles.

## Getting Started

Then run the following commands:

1. `npm install` to install necessary dev dependencies
2. `npm run start` (to watch for changes and generate a readable CSS file at /dev/styles.css)
3. `npm run build` (to generate)
